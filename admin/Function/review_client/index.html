                Definition of Review Text, Examples, Characteristics, Objectives, Structure and Rules - As academic
                people, we certainly have to read scientific works, including books. When we read a book, we must digest
                the reading book carefully so that we can understand its contents. On the other hand, we need to
                communicate our understanding in various forms for presentation or writing needs, such as research
                proposals, research reports, scientific articles, final assignments, or thesis. Therefore, students need
                the skills to review books.

                Review text is a text that contains reviews, ratings or reviews of a work such as a film, drama, or a
                book. Text review also called reviewer. When reviewing a work, reviewers must be critical so that the
                results of the review can contribute to the progress of the work.
